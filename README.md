## üîÑ Component Flow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **AdminTable.js**

- Manages all **core state**: selected rows, pagination, row expansion.
- Handles logic for:
  - Expanding rows with smooth scroll into view.
  - Selecting/deselecting rows via checkbox.
  - Deleting selected rows.
  - Passing theme toggle to the toolbar.

#### ‚ûï Also renders:

- `<AdminTableToolbar />`: Top bar with theme toggle and delete button.
- `<ActivityCollapse />`: Expandable rows showing activity logs + chart.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **AdminTableColumns.js**

- Exports a function `getAdminTableColumns(...)` that returns the column configuration for the `DataGrid`.
- Columns include:
  - Checkbox selector
  - Row expand/collapse icon
  - Profile image
  - ID, Name, Email, Role
  - Signup date, Last login, Status

üí° **Note:** It takes in `isRowSelected`, `handleSelectRow`, `toggleRow`, and `openRows` as props from the parent for dynamic behavior.

- Each user object contains:
  - id, name, email, role, signup date, last login
